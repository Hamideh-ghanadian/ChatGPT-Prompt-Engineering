This mini-coures is inspired from [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) website for Prompt Engineering.

Prompt engineering is the process of creating and refining prompts for artificial intelligence models such as language models. The goal of prompt engineering is to design prompts that enable the model to perform specific tasks or generate specific types of content.Prompt engineering involves creating prompts that are tailored to the specific task or application of the model, and that are optimized to produce the desired output. This can involve experimenting with different prompt formats, styles, and parameters to find the most effective combination.

Prompt engineering can be used in various applications of GPT models, including chatbots. In the context of chatbots, prompt engineering involves designing prompts that help the model generate more natural and appropriate responses to user input.

It's important to note that prompt engineering is an ongoing process that requires ongoing experimentation and refinement. This can involve analyzing user feedback, monitoring the model's performance over time, and adjusting prompts and parameters as needed to optimize performance.
